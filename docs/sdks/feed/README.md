## getAuthor

*This endpoint is part of the Bluesky application Lexicon APIs (`app.bsky.*`). Public endpoints which don't require authentication can be made directly against the public Bluesky AppView API: https://public.api.bsky.app. Authenticated requests are usually made to the user's PDS, with automatic service proxying. Authenticated requests can be used for both public and non-public endpoints.*

*To learn more about calling atproto API endpoints like this one, see the [API Hosts and Auth](/docs/advanced-guides/api-directory) guide.*

Get a view of an actor's 'author feed' (post and reposts by the author). Does not require auth.

### Example Usage

<!-- UsageSnippet language="typescript" operationID="app.bsky.feed.getAuthorFeed" method="get" path="/xrpc/app.bsky.feed.getAuthorFeed" -->
```typescript
import { Bluesky } from "@speakeasy-sdks/bluesky";

const bluesky = new Bluesky({
  bearer: process.env["BLUESKY_BEARER"] ?? "",
});

async function run() {
  const result = await bluesky.feed.getAuthor({
    actor: "<value>",
  });

  for await (const page of result) {
    console.log(page);
  }
}

run();
```

### Standalone function

The standalone function version of this method:

```typescript
import { BlueskyCore } from "@speakeasy-sdks/bluesky/core.js";
import { feedGetAuthor } from "@speakeasy-sdks/bluesky/funcs/feedGetAuthor.js";

// Use `BlueskyCore` for best tree-shaking performance.
// You can create one instance of it to use across an application.
const bluesky = new BlueskyCore({
  bearer: process.env["BLUESKY_BEARER"] ?? "",
});

async function run() {
  const res = await feedGetAuthor(bluesky, {
    actor: "<value>",
  });
  if (res.ok) {
    const { value: result } = res;
    for await (const page of result) {
    console.log(page);
  }
  } else {
    console.log("feedGetAuthor failed:", res.error);
  }
}

run();
```

## getSkeleton

*This endpoint is part of the Bluesky application Lexicon APIs (`app.bsky.*`). Public endpoints which don't require authentication can be made directly against the public Bluesky AppView API: https://public.api.bsky.app. Authenticated requests are usually made to the user's PDS, with automatic service proxying. Authenticated requests can be used for both public and non-public endpoints.*

*To learn more about calling atproto API endpoints like this one, see the [API Hosts and Auth](/docs/advanced-guides/api-directory) guide.*

Get a skeleton of a feed provided by a feed generator. Auth is optional, depending on provider requirements, and provides the DID of the requester. Implemented by Feed Generator Service.

### Example Usage

<!-- UsageSnippet language="typescript" operationID="app.bsky.feed.getFeedSkeleton" method="get" path="/xrpc/app.bsky.feed.getFeedSkeleton" -->
```typescript
import { Bluesky } from "@speakeasy-sdks/bluesky";

const bluesky = new Bluesky({
  bearer: process.env["BLUESKY_BEARER"] ?? "",
});

async function run() {
  const result = await bluesky.feed.getSkeleton({
    feed: "https://baggy-guidance.biz/",
  });

  for await (const page of result) {
    console.log(page);
  }
}

run();
```

import { feedGetSkeleton } from "@speakeasy-sdks/bluesky/funcs/feedGetSkeleton.js";

// Use `BlueskyCore` for best tree-shaking performance.
// You can create one instance of it to use across an application.
const bluesky = new BlueskyCore({
  bearer: process.env["BLUESKY_BEARER"] ?? "",
});

async function run() {
  const res = await feedGetSkeleton(bluesky, {
    feed: "https://baggy-guidance.biz/",
  });
  if (res.ok) {
    const { value: result } = res;
    for await (const page of result) {
