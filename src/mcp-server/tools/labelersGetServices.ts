    `*This endpoint is part of the Bluesky application Lexicon APIs (\`app.bsky.*\`). Public endpoints which don't require authentication can be made directly against the public Bluesky AppView API: https://public.api.bsky.app. Authenticated requests are usually made to the user's PDS, with automatic service proxying. Authenticated requests can be used for both public and non-public endpoints.*

*To learn more about calling atproto API endpoints like this one, see the [API Hosts and Auth](/docs/advanced-guides/api-directory) guide.*
