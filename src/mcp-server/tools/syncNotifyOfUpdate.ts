    `This endpoint is part of the atproto repository synchronization APIs. Requests usually do not require authentication, and can be made to PDS intances or Relay instances.*

*To learn more about calling atproto API endpoints like this one, see the [API Hosts and Auth](/docs/advanced-guides/api-directory) guide.*

Notify a crawling service of a recent update, and that crawling should resume. Intended use is after a gap between repo stream events caused the crawling service to disconnect. Does not require auth; implemented by Relay.
